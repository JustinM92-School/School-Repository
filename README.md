1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was for me to write a Grocery Tracking program that asks a user to enter a produce items name and then it will display the name of the item along with how many times the item was purchased in the form of asterisks.&nbsp;

2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe I formatted the code so it displayed in columns neatly and form fitting using setw code.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I believe I could enhance this code by making it more secure, along with adding even more features and making it part of a database. It would be more efficient by allowing even more items of along with possibly going off of a list of in stock items that would automatically add it to the list of sold items and update the frequency of the sold items as well.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

5. The hardest piece of code I came across was the Validation of the user input. I had to do a ton of google searches to come across suggestions that it turned out that I ended up accidently having an extra cin.ignore code and that messed up quite a bit of things for me. I now know to look more carefully.&nbsp;

6. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I believe that learning C++ in this project will help me going forward to create future projects as I now know how to do menu's well and loops better.

7. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable readable and adaptable by having a shorter Main function using a class and then also providing inline comments that are up to speed with best practices.&nbsp;
